# VPKPatcher
Finds and replaces files within a VPK binary file using byte by byte searching.

VPK files are used in source engine games to store data files, ie textures, sounds, particles, models etc.
This repository is private and never before uploaded as it bypasses anti-cheat systems allows hacks/cheats to run a muck in source games and can be used for nefarious means! :(
